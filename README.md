OpenStud is an unofficial Open Source client by [LithiumSR](https://github.com/lithiumsr/) for Sapienza's Infostud platform. This fork, initiated by [Matypist](https://github.com/matypist/), adapted it to the latest changes in the examination booking system and aims to continue its development.

It was developed with Java 8 and is compatible with Android 6.0+ (API Level 23+) devices. As of the time of writing, it is designed to work with Android 11 (API Level 30).
