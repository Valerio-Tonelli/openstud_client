## Features

OpenStud out of the box supports every feature which was present in the old Infostud Mobile app but it comes with a new look and modern code.

The features that are supported are:
- Student authentication (as expected);
- Get student profile (first name, last name, date of birth and so on and so forth);
- Get passed exams;
- Get doable exams;
- Get active reservations;
- Get available reservations;
- Compilation of the class' survey;
- Delete of an active reservation;
- Get and store a receipt of an active reservation;
- Get paid/unpaid taxes;
- Show stats based on student's performance;
- Get university's events and last news;
- Find classrooms and check their availability;
- Calendar with student's lessons, exams and reservations.

## What's next?

OpenStud is stable and it's perfectly working, but it's development is far from over.\
Some visual bugs needs to be fixed and some new features will be worked on (like biometrics support and widgets).
